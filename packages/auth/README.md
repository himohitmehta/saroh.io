# @saroh/auth

This package provides the authentication config file, we can use this in the application.

> In future we will update this to provide a single authentication wrapper based on top of next-auth to use in our apps.

it exports the `nextAuthInstance` that can be used in the apps to configure authentication.

It will be similar to the code here: [https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/auth/src/index.ts](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/blob/main/packages/auth/src/index.ts)
