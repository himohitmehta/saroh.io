We are just getting started and these are just a few things we have covered. This project will be updated regularly and I hope it will inspire you to learn more about full stack development. I will try to make it better and more helpful to everyone. I haven't planned of commercializing it yet, and I think even if someone learns from it and builds projects on top of it, that would be a great thing for me. More details will be added soon.
