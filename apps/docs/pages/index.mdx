## Introduction

[Saroh.io](https://saroh.io) is an open-source project built with NextJS, Tailwind CSS, PlanetScale, Next Auth, and Vercel. It is a monorepo maintained with turborepo.

Saroh.io is a multi-tenant application builder repository, which you can use to create your own multi-tenant applications.

The name "Saroh" is taken from the word "`Sāruṁ` (Gujarati: સારું)" which means "good". So it means I'm building something good and when uses it, they will also say it is good.

This is currently in its initial state and not ready for production use. It might not look good yet but soon, in the coming days, it will become better.

The Purpose of this project is to help people to build their own website with a few clicks and for aspiring developers it will be a good learning resource. I will try to keep the code as simple as possible so that it will be easy to understand so that anyone can easily understand what is happening here.

Later on, I will be adding more detailed docs here.
